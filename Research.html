  <h2>Resilience of Autonomous Systems</h2>
  
  <p>
	After docking to the International Space Station (ISS), the Nauka module suffered a software error causing its thrusters to misfire.
	In turn, these uncontrolled thrusters rotated the whole space station by 540° before being counteracted by other thrusters of the ISS.
	Motivated by such a scenario, my PhD thesis investigated the guaranteed resilience of autonomous systems to a similar class of malfunctions called partial loss of control authority over actuators.
	These malfunctions are characterized by actuators producing uncontrolled and undesirable outputs instead of following the controller’s commands.
	A loss of control authority can be caused, for instance, by a software bug as in the ISS example or by an adversarial takeover of some actuators of the system.
  </p>
  <p>  
	In this setting, I investigated the malfunctioning system's remaining capabilities to complete its mission in terms of resilient reachability and resilient trajectory tracking.
	I also quantified the resilience of linear systems by comparing the reachability performance of the nominal dynamics with that of the worst-case malfunctioning dynamics.
	I extended my resilience investigation to systems further inflicted with actuation delays preventing an immediate cancellation of the undesirable outputs.
	I illustrated my theory on a wide range of applications including an octocopter, a fighter jet model, and an orbital inspection mission illustrated by the following video.

	Mathematical details for resilience theory

<ul>
  <p>
  We consider a system of nominal dynamics 
  $$\dot{x}(t) = f\big(t, x(t)\big) + g\big(t, x(t)\big) \bar{B} \bar{u}(t), \qquad x(0) = x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n,$$
  with constant matrix $\bar{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (m+p)}$ and control signal $\bar{u}(t) \in \bar{\mathcal{U}}$.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  After a <em>partial loss of control authority</em>, $p$ of the initial $m+p$ actuators of the system are producing uncontrolled and possibly undesirable outputs within their full actuation range.
  We split $\bar{B}$ into the controlled actuators $B$ and the malfunctioning ones $C$. Similarly, signal $\bar{u}$ is split into the controls $u(t) \in \mathcal{U}$ and the undesirable inputs $w(t) \in \mathcal{W}$.
  The malfunctioning dynamics become 
  $$\dot{x}(t) = f\big(t, x(t)\big) + g\big(t, x(t)\big) \big(Bu(t) + Cw(t) \big), \qquad x(0) = x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n.$$
  </p>

  <p>
  This malfunction leads to several problems of interest:
  <ul>
    <li>can the malfunctioning system <em>resiliently reach</em> a given target?</li>
    <li>over which actuators can the system <em>resiliently</em> lose control?</li>
    <li>how to design a system <em>resilient</em> to the loss of control over any one of its actuators?</li>
    <li>how to quantify the <em>resilience</em> of a system?</li>
  </ul>
  I answered all of these questions during my PhD.

      <li>We started with linear driftless nominal dynamics $\dot{x}(t) = \bar{B} \bar{u}(t)$, with $x(0) = x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\bar{u}(t) \in \bar{\mathcal{U}}$.</li>
      <li>After a <em>partial loss of control authority over actuators</em>, the malfunctioning dynamics become $\dot{x}(t) = Bu(t) + Cw(t)$, $x(0) = x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$, with control $u(t) \in \mathcal{U}$ and undesirable input $w(t) \in \mathcal{W}$.</li>
      <li>A target $x_g$ is <em>resiliently reachable</em> if for all undesirable input $w$ there exists a control input $u$ driving the state of the malfunctioning system from $x_0$ to $x_g$.
        The nominal system is <em>resilient</em> if any target is resiliently reachable.</li>
      <li>We showed that resilience is equivalent to $BB^\top - CC^\top \succ 0$.</li>

    <li>We wanted to quantify how much longer the malfunctioning system needs to reach a target $x_g \in \mathbb{R}^n$ compared to the nominal dynamics, we introduce the <em>nominal reach time</em> 
      $$T_N^*(x_g) := \underset{\bar{u}(t) \, \in \, \bar{\mathcal{U}} }{\inf} \left\{ T : x_g - x_0 = \int_0^T \bar{B} \bar{u}(t) dt \right\},$$
    the <em>malfunctioning reach time</em>
      $$T_M^*(x_g) := \underset{w(t) \, \in \, \mathcal{W} }{\sup} \left\{ \underset{u(t) \, \in \, \mathcal{U} }{\inf} \left\{ T : x_g - x_0 = \int_0^T Bu(t) + Cw(t) dt \right\} \right\},$$
    and the <em>quantitative resilience</em> of the system
      $$r_q := \underset{x_g \, \in \, \mathbb{R}^n}{\inf} \frac{T_N^*(x_g)}{T_M^*(x_g)}.$$
    </li>
    <li>Relying on time-optimal control theory we simplified the expressions of the reach times $T_N^*$ and $T_M^*$. Then, we established the Maximax Minimax Quotient Theorem to solve the nonlinear optimization over $x_g$ in $r_q$.</li>

    <li>The problem of quantifying the resilience of driftless linear systems leads to a nonlinear optimization problem consisting of four nested optimizations :
    $$\underset{d\, \in\, \mathbb{S}}{\max}\ \frac{\underset{x\, \in\, \mathcal{X},\ y\, \in\, \mathcal{Y}}{\max} \big\{ \|x + y\| : x + y \in \mathbb{R}^+d \big\} }{ \underset{x\, \in\, \mathcal{X}}{\min} \big\{ \underset{y\, \in\, \mathcal{Y}}{\max} \big\{ \|x + y\| : x + y \in \mathbb{R}^+d \big\} \big\} },$$
      where $\mathcal{Y} := \big\{ Bu : u \in \mathcal{U} \big\}$ represents the admissible control inputs, while $\mathcal{X} := \big\{ Cw : w \in \mathcal{W} \big\}$ represents the undesirable and uncontrolled inputs.
    </li>
    <li>We developed a geometrical solution to this optimization in the case $\dim(\mathcal{X}) = 1$, which is illustrated in the video below generated by our <a href="https://github.com/Jean-BaptisteBouvier/Maximax-Minimax">MATLAB code</a>.</li>

      <li>To ensure transient safety in inverter-based microgrids, we develop a set invariance-based distributed safety verification algorithm for each inverter module.
	  Applying Nagumo’s invariance condition, we construct a robust polynomial optimization problem to jointly search for safety-admissible set of control set-points and design parameters,
	  under allowable disturbances from neighbors.
	  We use sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to solve the verification problem and we perform numerical simulations using grid-forming inverters to illustrate the algorithm.</li>
