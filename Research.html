  <h2>Resilience of Autonomous Systems</h2>
  
  <p>
	After docking to the International Space Station (ISS), the Nauka module suffered a software error causing its thrusters to misfire.
	In turn, these uncontrolled thrusters rotated the whole space station by 540° before being counteracted by other thrusters of the ISS.
	Motivated by such a scenario, my PhD thesis investigated the guaranteed resilience of autonomous systems to a similar class of malfunctions called partial loss of control authority over actuators.
	These malfunctions are characterized by actuators producing uncontrolled and undesirable outputs instead of following the controller’s commands.
	A loss of control authority can be caused, for instance, by a software bug as in the ISS example or by an adversarial takeover of some actuators of the system.
  </p>
  <p>  
	In this setting, I investigated the malfunctioning system's remaining capabilities to complete its mission in terms of resilient reachability and resilient trajectory tracking.
	I quantified the resilience of linear systems by comparing the reachability performance of the nominal dynamics with that of the worst-case malfunctioning dynamics.
	The resilience of driftless systems is quantified by the Maximax Minimax Quotient Theorem whose geometrical proof is illustrated on the video below.

  <p>	
	I extended my resilience investigation to systems further inflicted with actuation delays preventing an immediate cancellation of the undesirable outputs.
	I illustrated my theory on a wide range of applications including an octocopter, a fighter jet model, and an orbital inspection mission illustrated by the following video.

    <ul>
      <li>To ensure transient safety in inverter-based microgrids, we develop a set invariance-based distributed safety verification algorithm for each inverter module.
	  Applying Nagumo’s invariance condition, we construct a robust polynomial optimization problem to jointly search for safety-admissible set of control set-points and design parameters,
	  under allowable disturbances from neighbors.
	  We use sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to solve the verification problem and we perform numerical simulations using grid-forming inverters to illustrate the algorithm.</li>
