    <p>When failure is not an option, systems are designed to be resistant to various malfunctions, like a loss of control authority over actuators.
      This malfunction consists in some actuators producing uncontrolled and thus possibly undesirable inputs with their full actuation range. 
      After such a malfunction, a system is deemed resilient if its target is still reachable despite these undesirable inputs. 
      However, the malfunctioning system might be significantly slower to reach its target compared to its initial capabilities. 
      To quantify this loss of performance we introduce the notion of quantitative resilience as the maximal ratio over all targets of the minimal reach times for the initial and malfunctioning systems.
      Since quantitative resilience is then defined as four nested nonlinear optimization problems, we establish an efficient computation method for control systems with multiple integrators and nonsymmetric input sets.
      Relying on control theory and on two specific geometric results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a linear optimization problem. 
      We illustrate our method on an octocopter.  </p>

    After a loss of control authority over thrusters of the Nauka module, the International Space Station lost attitude control for 45 minutes with potentially disastrous consequences.
    Motivated by this scenario, we investigate the continued capability of control systems to perform their task despite partial loss of authority over their actuators.
    We say that a system is resilient to such a malfunction if for any undesirable inputs and any target state there exists an admissible control driving the state to the target.
    Building on controllability conditions and differential games theory, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the resilience of linear systems.
    As their task might be time-constrained, ensuring completion alone is not sufficient.
    We also want to estimate how much slower the malfunctioning system is compared to its nominal performance. 
    Relying on Lyapunov theory we derive analytical bounds on the reach times of the nominal and malfunctioning systems in order to quantify their resilience.
    We illustrate our work on the ADMIRE fighter jet model and on a temperature control system.

      Critical systems must be designed resilient to malfunctions and especially to a loss of control authority over actuators.
      This malfunction considers actuators producing uncontrolled and possibly undesirable outputs.
      We investigate the design of resilient linear systems capable of reaching their target even after such a malfunction.
      In contrast with the settings considered by robust control and fault-tolerant control, we consider undesirable but observable inputs of the same magnitude as controls since they are produced by a faulty actuator belonging to the system.
      The control inputs can then depend on these undesirable inputs.
      Building on our previous work, we focus on designing resilient systems able to withstand the loss of one or multiple actuators.
      Since resilience refers to the existence of a control law driving the state to the target, we naturally continue with the synthesis of such a control law.
      We conclude with the application of our theory to the ADMIRE fighter jet model.

    We present an optimization problem emerging from optimal control theory and situated at the intersection of fractional programming and linear max-min programming on polytopes.
    A naive solution would require solving four nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems.
    Instead, relying on numerous geometric arguments we determine an analytical solution to this problem.
    In the course of proving our main theorem we also establish another optimization result stating that the minimum of a specific minimax optimization is located at a vertex of the constraint set.

    Calculating low-thrust trajectories that connect geocentric orbits to Earth-moon halo orbits involves designing the many-revolution thrust arc required to depart Earth vicinity.
    Existing methods are based on solving the corresponding optimal control problem and hence are computationally expensive, involve providing hard-to-obtain initial guesses, and do not lend themselves well to quick parametric trade studies.
    In this paper, a stochastic optimization algorithm is coupled with a Lyapunov feedback control law to explore the solution space for designing Earth-to-halo low-energy low-thrust trajectories.
    While the objective is to minimize the fuel consumed for the transfer, the time of flight is constrained so as to optimally distribute the coast time between the low-thrust escape spiral and the low-energy arc.
    Engines are assumed to have a constant specific impulse and provide constant thrust throughout the transfer. The results obtained from this method are then compared with other available reference solutions in order to quantify its effectiveness in designing such transfers.
    Favorable comparisons thus obtained demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in calculating almost-optimal solutions, combined with a large improvement in computation time.

      Resilience of urban infrastructure to sudden, system-wide, potentially catastrophic events is a critical need across domains.
      The growing connectivity of infrastructure, including its cyber-physical components which can be controlled in real time, offers an attractive path towards rapid adaptation to adverse events and adjustment of system objectives.
      However, existing work in the field often offers piecemeal approaches to particular scenarios.
      On the other hand, abstract work on controlled complex systems focuses on attempting to adapt to the changes in the system dynamics or environment, but without understanding that the system may simply not be able to perform its original task after an adverse event.
      To address this challenge, this programmatic paper proposes a vision for a new paradigm of infrastructure resilience. Such a framework treats infrastructure across domains through a unified theory of controlled dynamical systems, but remains cognizant of the lack of knowledge about the system following a widespread adverse event and aims to identify the system's fundamental limits.
      As a result, it will enable the infrastructure operator to assess and assure system performance following an adverse event, even if the exact nature of the event is not yet known.
      Motivated by ongoing work on some facets of the broader problem of assured resilience, in this paper we identify promising early results, challenges that motivate the development of new theory, and possible paths forward for the proposed effort.

J.-B. Bouvier. Doctoral thesis: Guaranteed resilience of autonomous systems to loss of control authority over actuators. [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](), 2023.

J.-B. Bouvier. Master thesis: Orbit control for a spacecraft around a splitting contact binary asteroid. [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/109882), 2018.


  This thesis examines an orbit control problem for a spacecraft around a contact binary asteroid considering the dynamics of both the spacecraft and the asteroid itself.
 It is known that approximately 15\% of the near-Earth asteroids are binary, and among these the fraction of contact binaries is between 6 and 10\%.
 Most contact binary asteroids are constituted of an agglomeration of smaller boulders maintained together due to their internal gravity, which is a relatively unstable configuration.
 Therefore, even a minor change in their mass distribution, like would be caused by the landing of mining machines, can result in a modification of the asteroid's structure including a landslide or a splitting.
 Particularly, separation of the asteroid into two parts is problematic in terms of orbit control, because of the consequences on the gravitational field of the asteroid.
 Traditional two-body orbital control methods cannot be applied to the missions to those asteroids because they do not consider the dynamic activities of the asteroids themselves.
 This thesis proposes and evaluates a control method to follow a predefined path under unknown states of the splitting binary asteroid.
