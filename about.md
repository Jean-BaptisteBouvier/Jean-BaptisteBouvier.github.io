My name is Jean-Baptiste Bouvier and I am a postdoctoral researcher with interests spanning robotics, astrodynamics, autonomy, control theory, machine learning and optimization among others.

I completed my PhD in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in May 2023. I was working with [Prof. Melkior Ornik](https://mornik.web.illinois.edu), in the Learning, Decision, Control and Autonomy research group. My PhD work focused on the resilience of autonomous systems in the face of actuator malfunctions.
My PhD thesis is entitled ["Guaranteed Resilience of Autonomous Systems to Loss of Control Authority over their Actuators"](). During my PhD I also collaborated with [Prof. Robyn Woollands](https://woollands.web.illinois.edu/index.html) to study the resilience of orbital missions and with [Prof. Negar Mehr](http://negar.web.illinois.edu) to establish guarantees on dynamics learning.

Before starting my PhD at UIUC I worked for six months at [CNES](https://cnes.fr/en), the French space agency in Toulouse. During this internship I worked on Aurora a simulation software for mission planning of spacecraft constellations orbiting the Earth.

I completed my Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering at UIUC in 2018 where I worked with [Prof. Koki Ho](https://ae.gatech.edu/directory/person/koki-ho) in the [Space Systems Optimization Group](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/?_ga=2.135728057.946823942.1680189798-775619562.1680189798) which has now moved to GeorgiaTech. I worked on astrodynamics and more specifically in trajectory optimization in the three-body problem to design low-energy, low-thrust transfers. My Master thesis is entitled [Orbit Control for a Spacecraft around a Splitting Contact Binary Asteroid](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/109882). 

I was able to study at UIUC thanks to a dual degree program with the French aerospace engineering school [ISAE-Supaéro](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) where I also obtained a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2019.
Before focusing on aerospace I completed my undergraduate studies at one of the top French preparatory schools, the [Lycée du Parc](https://lyceeduparc.fr/ldp/rubrique1.html) in Lyon with a major in math and physics.


When I am not working, I am most likely training for my next triathlon or running race. I am an Ironman triathlete and I won the 2022 Illinois State Championship of triathlon!
